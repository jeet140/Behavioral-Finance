# Behavioral-Finance
In the context of financial markets, **behavioral finance** explores how psychological factors and biases affect investor behavior and market outcomes. This project applies behavioral finance concepts to analyze the **reversal effect** in the equity-share market using Python, focusing on the tendency for stocks that have performed poorly to outperform in the future and vice versa.

Using the **Jegadeesh & Titman (1993) methodology**, a seminal approach in the study of momentum and reversal effects, this analysis examines how behavioral finance principles influence stock returns. The project investigates **momentum** (the continuation of stock price trends) and **reversal effects** (the tendency for trends to reverse), identifying their prevalence across different market segments, including small-cap, medium-cap, and large-cap stocks.

Behavioral finance factors, such as **investor overreaction** and **underreaction**, are key to understanding the dynamics behind these effects. By analyzing the equity-share market, the project reveals a significant reversal effect that often outweighs momentum, particularly in small, medium, and large-cap stocks.

Python is utilized to automate the analysis and handle large datasets, enabling detailed examination of stock performance across market categories. The findings provide insights into how behavioral biases manifest in the market, driving reversal effects over time.
